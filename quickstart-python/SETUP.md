3. Open "Features" section and create new "Integration template" feature.
4. Choose the "Start from scratch" template and name your feature.
5. Create a new build and set the project's exposed URL in the "Base URL" field. (You can use
   Monday's [tunneling service](https://developer.monday.com/apps/docs/command-line-interface-cli#mapps-tunnelcreate) to
   expose your local server to the internet). This step is temporary and will be replaced with the URL of your app in
   Monday Code.

2. Enter the `Redirect URLs` tab.

Congrats, you have successfully set up the app in Monday! ðŸŽ‰

### Setting up the Environment Variables

1. For setting environment variables in production after deploying to monday-code-
    1. You can use @mondaycom/apps-cli to set the project secrets:
        1. Install apps-cli:
           ```bash
           $ npm i -g @mondaycom/apps-cli
           ```
        2. Set secrets:
           ```bash
           $ mapps code:env
           ```
           Choose the app to set environment variables > set > enter the secret key > then enter the value of the
           secret. The secret will be injected into process.env of your deployment.
    2. instead, you can set the secrets manually in monday-code by going to the `General` tab under monday code and
       then `Environment Variables` section.
